# Intro-To-Python

This content is based on the book _Think Python 2nd Edition_ by Allen B. Downey.  More information about the book can be found here: https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/


## Study Sessions on Youtube

Study sessions using this content can be found on the Cyber Insecurity ([website link](https://cyberinsecurity.tv/)) YouTube channel ([link](https://www.youtube.com/c/CyberInsecurity)) YouTube channel.  Study sessions are live streamed on Tuesday evenings at 8:00PM Eastern starting January 25, 2022.

Each stream will include an algorithm development exercise.  Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brenteskridge) to see the exercise prompt before the stream starts.

## Supplemental resources

Although this book presents the material very well, learners often benefit from seeing the same topics discussed from a different perspective.  To that end, I've compiled a curated list of supplementary resources that may prove to be beneficial.  These resources can be found here:

## Supplemental exercises

To supplement the exercises in the book, I've compiled a list of exercises that cover the same content as the book.  These exercises can be found here:
