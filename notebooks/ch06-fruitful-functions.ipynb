    "## Return values\n",
    "- Some of the functions we have used produce, or __return__, a value, but\n",
    "- Most of the functions we have written are _void__, meaning they don’t return any value\n",
    "- We are going to now focus on writing functions that return something\n",
    "- The book refers to these as __fruitful functions__\n",
    "- A ``return`` statement ends the function immediately and gives the value of the expression following it to the caller\n",
    "- The expression can be complicated, or a simple variable holding a value\n",
    "- A variable is preferred as it simplifies debugging\n",
    "- Just because a function returns a value doesn't mean that the caller has to use or store it- Also, you should only have one return statement in a function (despite what the book says)\n",
    "- Multiple return statements can complicate debugging code\n",
    "- Consider the code below"

    "  1. Start with a working program and make small, incremental changes.  At any point, if there is an error, you should have a good idea as to where it is.\n",
    "  1. Use temporary variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them.\n",
    "  1. Once the program is working, remove some of the scaffolding or consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions, but only if it doesn't make the program hard to read.\n",
    "- Displaying the algorithm's current progress is a simple form of __logging__\n",
    "- Adding print statements for crucial values as you write code is a form of __scaffolding__\n",
