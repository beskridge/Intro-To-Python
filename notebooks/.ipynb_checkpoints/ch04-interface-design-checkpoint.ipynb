    "To practice loops and turtle graphics, complete the following exercises from the textbook:\n",
    "1. Write a function called ``square`` that takes a parameter named t, which is a turtle. It should use the turtle to draw a square.  Write a function call that passes ``bob`` as an argument to square, and then run the program again.\n",
    "1. Add another parameter, named ``length``, to square. Modify the body so length of the sides is length, and then modify the function call to provide a second argument. Run the program again. Test your program with a range of values for length.\n",
    "1. The functions ``lt`` and ``rt`` make 90-degree turns by default, but you can provide a second argument that specifies the number of degrees. For example, ``lt(bob, 45)`` turns ``bob`` 45 degrees to the left.  Make a copy of square and change the name to polygon. Add another parameter named ``n`` and modify the body so it draws an n-sided regular polygon. Hint: The exterior angles of an n-sided regular polygon are 360.0/n degrees.\n",
    "1. Write a function called ``circle`` that takes a turtle, ``t``, and radius, ``r``, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle by invoking polygon with an appropriate length and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values of ``r``.  Hint: figure out the circumference of the circle and make sure that length * n = circumference.  Another hint: if ``bob`` is too slow for you, you can speed him up by changing ``bob.delay``, which is the time between moves, in seconds. ``bob.delay = 0.01`` ought to get him moving.\n",
    "1. Make a more general version of circle called ``arc`` that takes an additional parameter ``angle``, which determines what fraction of a circle to draw. ``angle`` is in units of degrees, so when ``angle=360``, ``arc`` should draw a complete circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like more of a challenge, try these additional exercises:\n",
    "1. Write a function called ``drawSpiral`` that takes a parameter named ``degrees`` that specifies the amount in degrees to draw a spiral.\n",
    "2. Write a function called ``drawStar`` that takes a parameter named ``length`` that draws a five-sided star with the specified side length.\n",
    "3. Write a function called ``drawCircles`` that takes a parameter named ``count`` that draws the specified number of circles side-by-side."
